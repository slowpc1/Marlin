** NOTICE: ** Several people are still testing this. If you want something more stable, you may want to wait. You can see the [current testing status, known issues, workarounds, and faq's here](TESTING_STATUS.md).

[A changelog is now available here](CHANGELOG.md)

# Marlin 2.x - Color UI - 3D Printer Firmware compiled for Elegoo Neptune 2

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

**Note:** The configurations and compiled versions are available in this bundle. 

This is a package of Marlin 2.x configurations for the Elegoo Neptune 2. The configurations are compatible with the Elegoo Neptune 2S. The source is a fork from [Marlin 2](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases). No changes have been made to the Marlin codebase, and only configuration files for the Elegoo Neptune 2 are added. 

These files are provided as opensource under the same [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) license as Marlin 2.

## Please Read and Consider:
I am providing these configurations to the community for free. If you find this helpful or your ETSY printer farm benefits from this (or makes you rich :grinning:), I would like you to please consider donating to a nonprofit close to my heart that supports my community. More information is at the end of this [README](#donation-request). 

# What are the features I get from using this?

All versions provided come with these features.

1. A safe version of alternative firmware.
   - I found a few configurations online and in repos that were not appropriately configured (Thermal runway protection was off or busted) 
1. An alternative UI
   - Not as "pretty", but much more helpful
   - Update many configuration values (including ESTEPS) right on the screen
   - PID Autotuning for the nozzle AND bed from the UI.  
1. [S-Curve Acceleration](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki/Jerk-Controlled-Motion-Explained)
1. Adaptive Step Smoothing
1. ARC Support Enabled
1. **M117** Change filament at layer.
1. Touchscreen will turn off after 2 min on the staus screen (tap it to turn it back on)
1. The progress screen will update if you are printing from Octoprint.

BLTouch versions also include:
1. Z Level Offset Wizard
1. **Live Z** Support
1. Bed tramming wizard option (I mean, you still need to level every once and a while)

# Do I lose any features if I use this?

The following items are not supported:

1. If you have a WIFI Card, it WILL NOT WORK (MKS made that call, not me) 
1. Icon previews do not exist in UI

# Setup and install

## Getting things ready

1. [Download the latest version here](https://github.com/just-trey/Marlin/releases/latest/download/Elegoo.zip).
2. Extract the zip file on your computer
3. Copy the desired `elegoo.bin` configuration to your SD Card. No other files are needed to install.  
   
   ***NOTE:*** **IT IS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW THE VERSION OF THE ZNP ROBIN NANO BOARD YOU HAVE, AND YOU NEED TO USE THAT VERSION OF THE FIRMWARE**
  
   - The directory structure is as follows:

     ![Screenshot from 2022-01-02 01-15-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10281380/147867833-04257d55-69a0-4653-8c9d-c61f433bf567.png)  
   - All firmware and configurations for 1.2 boards are in the 1.2 directory
   - All firmware and configurations for 1.3 boards are in the 1.3 directory
   - If you *DO NOT* have a BLOTUCH, use the file in the STOCK directory
   - If you *DO* have a BLOTUCH, use the file in the BLOTUCH directory

## Install

NOTE: the last four steps may seem a little odd, but I can confirm this is working reliably. I will be opening an ISSUE on the Marlin GitHub repo to see if there is a better way. 

1. Power off your printer
2. Put the sd card in with the appropriate `elegoo.bin` file... *Reminder: Did I mention to make sure you have the correct version for your board?*
3. Turn on your printer.
4. The firmware will install.
5. if a screen appears asking to set the EEPROM, click the checkmark.
6. Once installed, click on the calibration touchpoints. When the touch calibration is complete, it will display a confirmation message. You may think it froze but give it a little time.

   Please note: After you click the bottom right calibration point, reboot your machine if it prompts you to click the top left again. I have never had to do this more than twice when installing the firmware. This may be a unique issue to me because I have had it since I bought this printer.

7. If you reset your EEPROM on Step 5, you are good to go. If not, proceed to step 8. 
8. Click *SETTINGS ICON -> Configuration -> Advanced Settings -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Initialize EEPROM*
9. Click the Check on the confirmation screen
10. reboot your machine
11. Click the calibration touchpoints again if they come up
  
## (Optional, but recommended) PID AUTOTUNE your machine.

*Did you know?* - Elegoo ships with some default values for this, but they can vary with *every* machine. PID tuning is a safety feature, and unless you want my machine's values, I suggest you do this.

1. From the main screen click on *settings icon -> Configuration -> Advanced Settings -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Tempeture -> PID AUTOTUNE E1*
2. The nozzle will heat up and down for a few minutes. When completed, the screen will display a confirmation message on the bottom of the status screen.
3. From the main screen click on *settings icon -> Configuration -> Advanced Settings -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Tempeture -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> PID AUTOTUNE BED*
4. The bed will heat up and down for a few minutes. When completed, the screen will display a confirmation message on the bottom of the status screen.
5. From the main screen click on the *settings icon -> Configuration -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Store settings*

## TIPS

### Z Offset Wizard Location

Located at: *settings icon -> Configuration -> Advanced Settings -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Temperature -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Probe Offsets*

### Live Z Offset (Baby Stepping) Location

While printing:  *settings icon -> Tune -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Probe Z Offset*

### Dual Fan BT Touch Probe offsets

If you happen to use [this dual fan printhead](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4949488), the X offset is 47.5
You can set this at: *settings icon -> Configuration -> Advanced Settings -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Tempeture -> NEXT ARROW (>) -> Probe Offsets*

My son, Tyler Wentz, passed away after having a bodysurfing accident in 2015. We established a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization to raise money to provide two scholarships in our community to deserving students. We are 100% volunteer-driven, and 100% of donations (less the 2.7% Square Processing Fee) will go straight towards supporting the scholarships.

## Possible TODO's (PR's accepted)

1. Provide a configuration with linear advance on
2. Automate configuration building
